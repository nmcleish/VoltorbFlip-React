# Voltorb Flip - React

Voltorb Flip is a minigame of the Goldenrod and Celadon Game Corners in the Korean and Western releases of Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver. Voltorb Flip was described in a pre-release review as "a cross between Picross and Minesweeper". It features a five-by-five grid of tiles, underneath of which are hidden numbers (multiplier cards which affect the player's coins) and Voltorb (which Selfdestruct).
